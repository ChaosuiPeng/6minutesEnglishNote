It doesn't necessarily have to align with actual control.  这并不一定要与实际控制一致。  
In general, a messy room may lead your brain to tire so that it struggles to maintain its focus over long periods of concentration.  一般来说，凌乱的房间可能会使大脑感到疲惫，使其在长时间内难以集中注意力

Hi, I'm Lucy.
Hello, I'm Adam. Today let's talk about why small tasks feel so therapeutic.
Oh, thanks for taking my advice. I believe on this topic there's a lot we can write for our paper.
Yeah, it's an interesting topic. Tidying your desk, watering your plants or folding laundry — these household chores are hardly the height of hedonism. But I often find myself seeking pleasure and comfort in small repetitive tasks.
Same. If I'm waiting for an important telephone call, or stuck in writer's block with a looming deadline, I'll inevitably rearrange my record collection or clear up the papers dotted around my office — and it's sometimes the most relaxed I feel all day.
You're not alone in this. As we faced the stressed of the pandemic, many people reported finding renewed interest in looking after their homes as a way of coping with the uncertainty. On YouTube, there's even a huge audience for videos of other people going about their chores, with millions of views for some of the most popular clips.
Haha, I watched some and I love them so much.
Psychologists suggest there are many potential mechanisms that might explain the perfect pleasure of puttering — and they may well encourage you to engage in it more often. 
At the most superficial level, puttering may be useful because it occupies the mind, so that we devote fewer resources to the things that are worrying us.
I fully understand it. Even if I struggle with structured forms of meditation, for instance, I may find household tasks can anchor me in the here and now.
In one of the few studies to examine the mental health benefits of washing the dishes, researches at Florida State University divided 51 participants into two groups. Half read a text that encouraged them to focus their thoughts to the sensations evoked by the activity. 
Can't believe there's a study examing the mental function of washing the dishes.
No one can stop the flight of the researchers' thoughts. So this group of participants were told that While washing the dishes one should be completely aware of the fact that one is washing the dishes. The rest read factual instructions on how to do the washing up without explicitly encouraging them to focus otheir awareness on the sensations it produces.
Did they really wash the dishes or not?
...Yes, they did. Afterward, the participants were asked to take a questionnaire about their feelings. Those who had fully engaged with the sensory experience reported a significantly better mood. This included reduced nervousness and even a sense of "inspiration", as if the immersion in the simple activity had refreshed their minds.
How about playing computer games or watching trashy TV? Do they make people feel the same way?
It's different. Usually it's puttering that can be proactive and useful, increasing our "perceived control".
Exmplain it further, please.
When we feel anxious, a sense of helplessness can heighten the physiological stress response, increasing levels of hormones such as cortisol. Ideally, we would deal directly with the upsetting situation itself. But research suggests we can gain a perception of control from activities that may have little effect on the situation that's bothering us.
Such as washing the dishes?
Right. Stacey Bedwell, a psychologist at the Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology & Neuroscience, King's College London told us that It doesn't necessarily havt to align with actual control. Simply being able to change our environment can crete a feeling of agency that is beneficial, she says — which may explain why cleaning and organizing our homes can feel so therapeutic.
I see. It reminds me an interesting research on older people.
You must be talking about the classic paper by professor Ellen Langer at Harvard University and professor Judith Rodin at Yale University.
Yes! The study took place at a nursing home, where participants were divided into two groups. The first were allowed to make their room their own: they were allowed to arrange the furniture however they liked, and they were given a plant that they had to care for themselves. And the second group, meanwhile, were told that the staff could take care of everything; they even didn't have to water their plant.
You remember the result?
Sure, over the following 18 months, the residents who were encouraged to take responsibility for their room enjoyed better physical health and were less likely to die.
I guess the benefit was primarily coming from their increased sense of control over their lives.
The benefits do not end there. If your puttering takes the form of organising and decluttering, you may find that the tidier environment is itself a form of solace.
I can't agree more. If I'm sitting at my kitchen table with my laptop surrounded by clutter, I need to try very hard to concentrate on the task at hand.
As the University of Michigan psychologist Ethan Kross writes in his book, if we see order outside, it helps us to feel a bit less chaotic inside.
Ingeneral, a messy room may lead your brain to tire so that it struggles to maintain its focus over long periods of concentration.
So we necessarily need to rearrange the clutter to prevent this from occuring.
Organizing objects into groups —by colour, forexample — may provide the brain with more obvious cues for navigating the chaos.
That would be a good solution. This reduces some of that neural confusion — and may improve our focus as a result.
